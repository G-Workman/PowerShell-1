-Force      <------ forces the command to work
-ErrorAction <----- When recieve an error, decide what you want the system to do with it, otions will appear after typing -ErrorAction
man = get-help (preset alias)

PARAMTERS

Get-Childitem -path C:\ -recurse -filter *.pf -name           <------ recurse is our switch parameter (places the list recursively)
Switch paramter: Boolean in nature. When used, the parameter is turned on, otherwise its off by default

Get-Childitem -path C:\ -recurse -filter *.pf -name     <------- -path is our positional parameter
Gives a parameter a fixed parameter, meaning -path goes directly with C:\ because C:\ is the next string that follows the positional parameter

get-service -name power,Dnscache    <------ to list multiple paramters, use a "," because a space to powershell is a different parameter

get-service -name power,Dnscache   <------ -name is a "common parameter" which mean it applies to most, if not all commands in powershell
